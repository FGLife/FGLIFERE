        <p><em>Modified November 13, 2017</em></p>
        <p>This page sets forth the terms
          and conditions under which F&G Re makes this site available to you, as well as the terms
          and conditions governing your use of this site. By making use of this site, you agree to be bound by the terms
          and conditions stated below, as they may be modified from time to time. Modifications to these terms and
          conditions of use shall be effective immediately upon their posting on the site. If you do not accept these
          terms and conditions, please do not continue to use or access this site. </p> 


        <h3 class="blue-heading">Limitation of Liability</h3>

        <p>The site and its content are provided “as is” and without warranties of any kind, either expressed or
          implied, including, but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular
          purpose. F&G Re does not warrant that use of the site will be uninterrupted or
          error-free, that defects, if any, will be corrected, or that either the site or the server that makes it
          available to you is free of viruses, disabling devices or other harmful components. F&G Re
          does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials
          on the site in terms of their correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. You (and not F&G Re)
          assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction related to any damage,
          harm, injury or malfunction associated with your use of the site and/or its contents.</p><br>

        <p>Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence by act or omission, shall F&G Re or any party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the site, be liable for any direct,
          incidental, consequential, indirect or punitive damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use,
          the materials on the site, even if F&G Re or a representative authorized by F&G Re has been advised of the possibility of such damages. By using the site, you accept at your
          own risk that the Internet and online communications medium may not perform as intended. Applicable law may
          not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above
          limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. In no event, however, shall F&G Re total
          liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for
          accessing the site.</p><br>

        <h3 class="blue-heading">Use of the Site; Copyrights, Trademarks &amp; Service Marks</h3>

        written permission of the party from whom F&G Re has licensed such material. You may access the F&G Re owned material on the site for non-commercial, personal use only,
        provided you also retain all copyright and other proprietary notices contained on the materials. You may not use, distribute, modify, transmit, reuse or repost such material for public or commercial purposes without the prior written permission of F&G Re. F&G Re neither warrants nor
        represents that your use of materials displayed on the site will not infringe rights of third parties not owned

          that some of the pages on this site provide hypertext links to other sites created by other organizations. We
          provide you links to other sites as a free service. Because those other sites are not under our control, we

        <h3 class="blue-heading">Communications</h3>  

        <p>Personal Data is personal and/or confidential information data that relates to you, your
          account with F&G Re and the information personal to you and your account. At times you
          may initiate communications with us or we may request certain information from you that does not relate to your
          account. We refer to these interchanges as "Communications." Any Communications or material you transmit to
          the site by electronic mail or otherwise, including data, questions, comments or suggestions, with the exception
          of Personal Data transmitted regarding you or your account, will be treated as non-confidential and
          non-proprietary and will become the property of F&G Re and/or its affiliates (this information is
          referred to herein as "Non-Confidential Communications"). Such Non-Confidential Communications may be used for a
          variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast and
          posting. Furthermore, F&G Re retains the right to use ideas, concepts, know-how, or
          techniques contained in any Non-Confidential Communications you send to the site for any purpose whatsoever,
          including, but not limited to, developing and marketing products using such information. You agree that you
          shall have no recourse against F&G Re for any alleged or actual infringement or
          misappropriation of any proprietary right in your Non-Confidential Communications to us.</p>  


          <h3 class="blue-heading">Collection of Information from Site Visitors </h3>  
        <p>If you send comments or questions via e-mail to any mail box provided on our sites, we will share your
          communications with our customer service representatives and those employees or agents most capable of
          addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to
          provide you with a complete and satisfactory response and then we will either discard it or, in some cases,
          archive it.</p>

          <p>Please note that, unless we expressly advise you otherwise, the e-mail facilities at our
        sites do not provide a means for completely secure and private communications between us. Like most, if not all,
        non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications, your e-mail may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users,
        without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please
        do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. If you wish, you may
        contact F&G Re instead via telephone at the numbers provided at various locations on our
        sites.</p>

          <p>You should also be aware that when you visit our web site, we collect certain information that
        does not identify you personally, but provides us with "usage data", such as the number of visitors we receive,
        what pages are visited most often, and what browser and domain name you are using.  Additionally, we may gather
        non-personally identifiable demographics and interests data about you using a feature provided by Google
        Analytics through use of “cookie” technology (described below).  This information my include demographics data,
        such as your age and gender, and information about your general interests, based on Google’s algorithm.  None of
        the demographics and interests information that we will gather will be personally identifiable, and this
        information will not be used in any way relating to your insurance application or policy. Learn more about <a
          href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/"> Google's privacy policy</a>. The sole purpose of this data is
        to continually improve the usefulness of the information we provide at this site.</p>

          <p>Like most commercial
        web sites, we may also use on this site what is known as web browser "cookie" technology or other online
        tracking technologies and analytical tools, to customize our websites, mobile applications, and social media
        interactions to enhance your overall customer experience. A "cookie" is a non-executable element of data that
        a web site can send to your browser when you link to that site. By assigning a unique data element to each
        visitor, the web site is then able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better serve you when
        you return to that site. The cookie does not extract personal information about you. This cookie resides on
        your computer until your Internet browser is turned off and is used to make it easier for you to navigate
        among different pages at this website. This cookie does not collect any personally identifiable information
        about you. Most browsers provide a simple procedure that will enable you to control whether you want to
        receive cookies by notifying you when a web site is about to deposit a cookie file. You can also opt out of
        Google Analytics by downloading and installing the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin">Opt-out
          Browser Add-on</a>. Our mobile and social media applications may also collect non-personally identifiable
        demographic information (such as age, sex, and city/state location) about the users of each application. This
        website contains hyperlinks to other websites on the Internet which we do not control, are not governed by our
        privacy practices and policies and for which we are not responsible. Before you provide information to any of
        these other websites, you should review their terms of service (or similar legal terms) and their privacy
        policies so that you know what information is collected by the website and what use or disclosure may be made
        of information you provide to the website.  Our website does not engage in collecting personally identifiable
        information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We have
        not authorized any third party to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities
        over time and across different websites when you visit our website. Thus, our website does not respond to web
        browser "do not track" track signals or other similar mechanisms.</p><br>
